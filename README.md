## Hello World, I'm Nate

### 🔧 R Enthusiast | Data Whisperer | Code Conjurer | Freelance Plumber
I spend my days making data behave and my nights arguing with ggplot2. If you need help turning a messy dataset into a beautiful visualization, I’m your person. If you need help with dplyr, I can unclog your pipes as an expert data plumber.

### ⚡️ Currently Working On:
* Making R less scary for newcomers (and also for myself, sometimes).
* Writing functions that don’t throw errors (still a work in progress).
* Trying to understand why tidyr is always a good idea.
    
### 📚 Fun Fact: I once debugged an R script so well, I made the data cry… from joy.
