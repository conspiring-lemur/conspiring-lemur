## Hello World, I'm Nate

### üîß R Enthusiast | Data Whisperer | Code Conjurer | Freelance Plumber
I spend my days making data behave and my nights arguing with ggplot2. If you need help turning a messy dataset into a beautiful visualization, I‚Äôm your person. If you need help with dplyr, I can unclog your pipes as an expert data plumber.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Currently Working On:
\b    ‚Ä¢    Making R less scary for newcomers (and also for myself, sometimes).
\b    ‚Ä¢    Writing functions that don‚Äôt throw errors (still a work in progress).
\b    ‚Ä¢    Trying to understand why tidyr is always a good idea.
    
### üìö Fun Fact: I once debugged an R script so well, I made the data cry‚Ä¶ from joy.
